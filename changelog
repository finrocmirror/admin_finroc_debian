finroc-13.10 (13.10+20150830114207-0ubuntu1) stable; urgency=low

  * Upstream modifications

    == finroc ==
      [Tobias Föhst]
      Fixed various bugs and warnings
      port_name_builder now excludes pointers to ports from name generation
      Added scoped named branches (to ease restrictions on named branches)
      Adds a finroc.org path to each hgrc to ease comparison with upstream repositories
      Fixed non-linear updates in finroc_update and handling of empty repositories or uncommitted merges
      Fixed simulation mode of finroc_sync (really does not change things now) and added support for runtime construction

    == finroc_core ==
      [Max Reichardt]
      Bugfix in GetFinrocFileToSaveTo() - now properly deals with absolute paths
      Corrected error message and improved some source code comments.
      Bugfix: Connection events on unpublished ports no longer get lost.

    == finroc_plugins_data_ports ==
      [Max Reichardt]
      Bugfix in tPortCreationInfo. Flags are now always interpreted as flags in port constructors. They were interpreted as default value before if port data type T accepted core::tFrameworkElementFlag enum class in its constructor.
      Fixed bug (erroneous use of std::vector::erase in uncritical loop)
      Bugfix: If value to publish for some reason (e.g. port not ready or value out of bounds) could not be assigned to publishing port, programs could under some circumstances crash.

    == finroc_plugins_ib2c ==
      [Jochen Hirth]
      Replaced emplace_back by push_back to support usage of bool.

      [Tobias Föhst]
      Corrects order of ctor parameters for derived activity ports

    == finroc_plugins_parameters ==
      [Max Reichardt]
      Made tStaticParamaterList deserialization cope with missing 'Par ' prefixes that are now removed from auto-generated static parameter names.

    == finroc_plugins_tcp ==
      [Max Reichardt]
      Fixed bug (erroneous use of std::vector::erase in loop). Could have caused minor communication delays with calls.
      Fixes rare bug in memory management at shutdown

    == finroc_tools_finstruct-java ==
      [Max Reichardt]
      Fix in PaintableViewer (port view): Rulers are now updated when auto-fitting is enabled

    == finroc_tools_gui-java ==
      [Max Reichardt]
      Repaired and improved ValueInputField widget (now only publishes values on enter - and indicates this visually)
      Fixed issue (low update rate of value input widgets) in last commit

    == make_builder ==
      [Daniel Schmidt, Jens Wettach, Massimo Tosa, Max Reichardt, Michael Arndt, Patrick Fleischmann, Steffen Hemer, Thomas Pfister, Thorsten Ropertz, Tobias Groll]
      Updated libdb.raw

      [Max Reichardt]
      libenum_strings can now handle enums with custom (non-standard) values. Modified EnumStringsBuilderHandler to generate and register enum values appropriately.
      clang-based enum strings build no longer tries to handle private or protected enums
      Enum strings builder now deals with enums defined in templates appropriately.
      Improved support for NVCC
      Improved support for Qt4 moc and uic
      Adapted to clang 3.5
      Makes clang port name builder remove 'par' prefix for static parameters
      Extends makebuilder for cross-compiling
      Fix in 'Finroc System Library Loader': no longer crashes when pkgconfig directory is missing
      Improved error messags

      [Tobias Föhst]
      Improved robustness for different environments (independence of $PATH, initialization of CCFLAGS with CFLAGS, matching of full filenames in search for library)
      Being more informative about missing libdb files
      Extends makebuilder for cross-compiling
      Adapted to clang 3.6

    == rrlib_serialization ==
      [Max Reichardt]
      Bugfix in memory buffer when wrapping existing memory and writing to it.

    == rrlib_speech_synthesis ==
      [Max Reichardt]
      Added missing pthread dependency to make.xml

    == rrlib_util ==
      [Bernd Helge Leroch]
      fixed issue in the context of name resolution

      [Tobias Föhst]
      Bugfix: casts are not allowed in #if expressions (and CLOCKS_PER_SEC resolves to one in c++11)
      Bugfix: special member functions for move semantics are not generated if others are declared. This restores default movability of non-copyable objects.
